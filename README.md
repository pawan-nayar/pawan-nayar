I’m a content engineer with over 30 years of experience building systems that connect words, knowledge, and creativity. From Microsoft CBT projects in 1995, to Cadence and Adobe, to today’s BeyondDictionary → **LLOS.AI**, my work has always centered on one vision: scaling content engineering for the next billion learners and creators.

### ✨ CMET — My Core Philosophy

My work is guided by the **CMET** framework: a mesh where **C**ontent, **M**arketing, **E**xperience, and **T**echnology are not silos, but a unified system where each side fuels the other.

| Combination | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Content + Tech` | How knowledge reaches at scale |
| `Content + Marketing` | Telling the right story at the right time |
| `Content + Experience` | Making ideas simple enough for a 5-year-old, rich enough for a researcher |
| `Marketing + Experience` | Making people feel heard, not sold to |
| `Experience + Tech` | Showing up everywhere people are — phone, web, and voice |

> This is the weave behind everything I build — BeyondDictionary, FindYourExpression™, and the Wisdom Graph.
